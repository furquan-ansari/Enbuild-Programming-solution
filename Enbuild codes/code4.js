// Question 4 :-
/* Consider one integer array. Update the array as per the following requirements:
- If the element is negative number then make the square of the number
- Keep the 0 as is
- If the number is positive even number then add the same even number to that
- If the number is positive odd number then print the next odd number to that
Ex. {0, 13, 5, -4, 6} --> {0, 15, 7, 16, 12}
